        Here are some example:

        Input caption: a white dog on the left of two cats.
        Answer:
        Attribute Dict: {"white dog": {"number": 1, "location description": "Its location relationship is mentioned, it's on the left of the two cats. So I think it is on the left side of the picture."}
        "cats": {"number": 2, "location description": "There are a dog on the left of they mentioned in the caption mentioned, so i determined that the two cats should on the right side of the picture, and one is on the top right and one is on the bottom right"}}

        ### Example2:
        Input caption: Two person and a horse.
        Answer:
        Attribute Dict: {"person": {"number": 2, "location description": "No specific location mentioned, so I assume that one person are ridding the horse and another stood by, leading the horse. So one person is on the horse, the other person is in front of the horse, and I'm assuming the horse is to the right, so the other person is on the right of the horse. And The specific position of the two person in the frame depends on the position of the horse."},
